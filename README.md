# hash_applications

Uses count-min sketch to approximately count the number of unique words in famous literary works, "The Great Gatsby" and "War and Peace" via .txt files provided from Project Guttenberg. 

Histogram plots are generated to show the discrepancy between the count-min sketch tallies of each word in the text vs the actual word count. 

Finally, a bloom filter is used to count the common words between the two books.
